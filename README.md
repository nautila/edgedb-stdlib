# EdgeDB stdlib

> A collection of EdgeDB standard library database schema definitions.

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress.

Currently just a few basic abstract types and scalars - something to get the ball rolling.

Other things either in the works or on the drawingboard:

- [ ] **User and organizational account management** - basic user management, and being able to associat a user with multiple organizations.
- [ ] **User subtypes** - such as API service accounts.
- [ ] **Roles and permissions** - basic role and permission based access for users and organizations.
- [ ]Â **Addresses and locations** - storing addresses and geospatial locations in a structured manner.
- [ ] **Audit logging** - a way to log changes to data in the database.

**Suggestions and contributions highly appreciated!**
